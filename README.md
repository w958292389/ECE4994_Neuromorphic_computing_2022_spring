This document describe how to use the code I provided.
The file should be use on colab since they are ipynb file.
Appeltant_DFR_Implementation is the original program that implement the Appeltant's algorithm on DFR with ridge regression as the weight function
Narma10_dfr_testbench is the is the same program as the first program. But with different weight functions like original weight function, gradient descent algorithm and stochastic gradient descent. The prupose of this program is to test the impact of different weight function on DFR, how I can improve the accuracy of predicted output.
